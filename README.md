## Introduction

The Full Scale Body Mass Index Prediction System predicts the BMI category based on user inputs such as gender, height, and weight. The serverless deployment ensures scalability and cost-effectiveness by leveraging AWS Lambda and Zappa for seamless function execution.

## Features

- **BMI Prediction**: Predicts BMI category based on user inputs.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Deployed using AWS Lambda, providing automatic scaling and high availability.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a web interface for user interaction.
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for the compute time you consume.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **AWS CLI** configured with your AWS account
- **Zappa**
- **Flask**
- **scikit-learn**
- **pandas**
- **numpy**
